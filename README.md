## How To Play

Click on a cell to uncover it and start the game. A number in a cell represents how many mines are in the 8 neighboring cells. If there are no mines in the neighboring cells, those cells will be automatically uncovered. Uncover all safe cells in the grid to win. If you uncover a mine, the game is over. You may right-click on a cell to flag it as a mine and right-click again to unflag it. Try to clear all three difficulty levels!
